# Option B Implementation Test Results

**Date**: 2026-06-14  
**Status**: ✅ Option B suite green (13/13); full repo suite 34/34 under `.venv` + pytest

> **2026-06-14 correction.** After the injector was rewritten from a hand-rolled
> urllib client to the Band SDK `thenvoi_rest.RestClient` (commit `de4356a`),
> three tests went stale and started failing — `test_rest_api_endpoints` still
> asserted a removed `_rest_call`/`/me/chats` string, and the two integration
> tests patched `urllib.request.urlopen`, which the new code never calls, so they
> fell through to a **real** Band API request (live 401). They've been rewritten
> to mock `thenvoi_rest.RestClient` and now assert the SDK call sequence with no
> network. Also: pytest is now installed in `.venv`, so the whole suite runs on
> one interpreter (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q`).

## What Was Tested

### 1. **Validation Tests** (8 tests — `test_option_b.py`)

All tests confirm the Option B design is correctly implemented:

- ✅ **Injector alert message**: Builds alert with @Triage mention
- ✅ **Triage allowlist**: Includes `thenvoi_create_chatroom` platform tool
- ✅ **Triage prompt**: Instructs room creation and specialist recruitment
- ✅ **Protocol consistency**: §C, §E.2, §E.3 sections align (intake room, creation-based)
- ✅ **Injector refactor**: Removed `default_room_id` dependency
- ✅ **REST endpoints**: Posts via the Band SDK `RestClient` human API (`human_api_chats.create_my_chat_room` / `add_participant`, `human_api_messages.send_my_chat_message`) — no raw urllib
- ✅ **BRIEF message format**: Mentions human CISO in incident room
- ✅ **Config state**: `room.default_room_id` stays blank (creation-based, not fallback)

### 2. **Integration Tests** (5 tests — `test_option_b_integration.py`)

Tests validate the REST call flow with `thenvoi_rest.RestClient` mocked — no
real Band API calls:

- ✅ **REST call sequence**: Injector makes 3 SDK calls in correct order
  1. `human_api_chats.create_my_chat_room(...)` → create intake room → returns `.id`
  2. `human_api_chats.add_participant(chat_id, agent_id=triage)` → add Triage
  3. `human_api_messages.send_my_chat_message(chat_id, message=...)` → post alert @mentioning Triage
- ✅ **Endpoint patterns**: Confirms the human-API surface is used (not agent API), and the alert mention carries Triage's id
- ✅ **Triage context switching**: Prompt clarifies intake room vs incident room
- ✅ **Message schema**: ProtocolMessage supports BRIEF with `recruited` field
- ✅ **Code isolation**: Commander doesn't have `create_chatroom`; only Triage does

## What Still Needs Live Testing

### Real Band API Integration
The tests mock the HTTP layer. To fully validate, you need:

1. **BAND_INJECTOR_API_KEY** set (user API key from Band UI)
2. Run: `python -m injector.inject_alert INC-C`
3. Observe:
   - Intake room created + Triage added
   - Alert posted mentioning Triage
   - Triage agent reads alert, classifies it, creates incident room
   - Incident room appears in Band UI with Triage + CISO + recruited specialists

### Triage Runtime Validation
- Does Triage correctly handle context switching (intake room → incident room)?
- Does `thenvoi_create_chatroom` return the room ID that Triage can then `add_participant` to?
- Do tool calls (classify_alert, lookup_asset) work in the new flow?
- Does Triage properly add the CISO via `thenvoi_add_participant(@merolavtech)`?

### End-to-End Incident Flow
Run the full Phase 4 test with INC-C:
- Triage creates room, recruits Threat Intel + Compliance + Commander
- Threat Intel + Compliance analyze with their tools
- Cross-examination messages exchanged
- Commander recruits CISO at escalation
- CISO rules, Commander executes, report exports

## Architecture Changes Summary

| Component | Change | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **protocol.md §C** | Q4 decision clarified: Triage creates room | Documentation was stale (Option C) |
| **protocol.md §E.2** | Intake room pattern documented | Explains alert kickoff mechanism |
| **injector** | Creates intake room instead of posting to pre-made | Enables Triage-driven incident creation |
| **injector** | Removed `room.default_room_id` dependency | No more pre-created rooms |
| **triage main.py** | Added `create_chatroom` to allowlist | Triage now owns room creation |
| **triage prompt** | Added room creation instructions | Guides Triage through incident setup |

---

## Known Limitations & Edge Cases

1. **Intake room cleanup**: The intake room persists after Triage creates the incident room. Decision: acceptable for demo (rooms are ephemeral on free tier anyway).

2. **Context switching robustness**: Triage makes tool calls (`classify_alert`, `lookup_asset`) in intake room, then `create_chatroom` returns a new `room_id`. All subsequent messages must post to the new room, not the intake room. Triage's prompt clarifies this, but it's a potential source of bugs if the LLM loses context.

3. **CISO addition timing**: The prompt says Triage adds CISO immediately after creating the room. The CISO won't see the intake room (good), but will see the BRIEF and all subsequent messages in the incident room (expected behavior per Phase 0).

4. **Cross-account Compliance**: Triage adds Compliance via `thenvoi_add_participant` after the agent-to-agent contact is approved. This worked in Phase 2; Option B replicates the same pattern.

## Next Steps

### Before Demo / Phase 5
- [ ] Run `python -m injector.inject_alert INC-C` with BAND_INJECTOR_API_KEY set
- [ ] Verify intake room is created and contains Triage + alert
- [ ] Verify Triage creates the incident room and recruits specialists
- [ ] Verify BRIEF @mentions human + all specialists
- [ ] Run INC-A (no escalation expected) and INC-B (close at triage) to validate proportionality

### If Real API Calls Fail
Common issues & fixes:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Triage sees nothing" | Mention handle wrong | Check §E.0 handles; grep for `@merolavtech/triage` |
| "Intake room not created" | REST API 403 or 401 | Verify BAND_INJECTOR_API_KEY is valid user key (not agent) |
| "Triage can't add CISO" | add_participant endpoint issue | Verify CISO handle `@merolavtech` (just handle, no framework) |
| "Room context lost" | LLM forgot to switch rooms | Triage prompt may need example showing room ID usage |

## Test Coverage

- **Unit/structural**: 8 tests validating code structure, imports, schema consistency
- **Integration (mocked)**: 5 tests validating REST call sequence without hitting real API
- **E2E (manual)**: Pending — requires live Band account + agents running

Estimated live testing time: **5–10 min** (one incident end-to-end).
